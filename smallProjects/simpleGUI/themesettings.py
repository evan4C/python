"""
    Allows you to "browse" through the Theme settings.  Click on one and you'll see a
    Popup window using the color scheme you chose.  It's a simple little program that also demonstrates
    how snappy a GUI can feel if you enable an element's events rather than waiting on a button click.
    In this program, as soon as a listbox entry is clicked, the read returns.
