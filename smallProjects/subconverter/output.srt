2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,380
It is my pleasure to welcome Dr. Andrew Ng, tonight.
3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,770
Andrew is the managing general partner of AI Fund,
4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,850
founder of DeepLearning.AI and Landing AI,
5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,120
chairman and co-founder of Coursera,
6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,870
and an adjunct professor of Computer Science, here
7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,130
at Stanford.
8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,570
Previously, he had started and led the Google Brain
9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,290
team, which had helped Google adopt modern AI.
10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,190
And he was also director of the Stanford AI lab.
11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,430
About eight million people, 1 in 1,000 persons on the planet,
12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,160
have taken an AI class from him.
13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,150
And through, both, his education and his AI work,
14
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,920
he has changed numerous lives.
15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,370
Please welcome Dr. Andrew Ng.
16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,310
[APPLAUSE]
17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,060
Thank you, Lisa.
18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,480
It's good to see everyone.
19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,110
So, what I want to do today is chat to you
20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,050
about some opportunities in AI.
21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,230
So I've been saying AI is a new electricity.
22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,750
One of the difficult things to understand about AI
23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,760
is that it is a general purpose technology,
24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,270
meaning that it's not useful only for one thing
25
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,550
but it's useful for lots of different applications,
26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,780
kind of like electricity.
27
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,570
If I were to ask you, what is electricity good for?
28
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,173
It's not any one thing, it's a lot of things.
29
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,340
So what I'd like to do is start off sharing with you
30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,350
how I view the technology landscape,
31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,040
and this will lead into the set of opportunities.
32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,430
So lot of hype, lot of excitement about AI.
33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,830
And I think, a good way to think about AI
34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,180
is as a collection of tools.
35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,880
So this includes, a technique called supervised learning,
36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,090
which is very good at recognizing things or labeling
37
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,870
things, and generative AI, which is a relatively new, exciting
38
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,710
development.
39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,100
If you're familiar with AI, you may have heard of other tools.
40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,630
But I'm going to talk less about these additional tools,
41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,509
and I'll focus today on what I think are, currently,
42
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,060
the two most important tools, which are supervised learning
43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,860
and generative AI.
44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,040
So supervised learning is very good at labeling things
45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
or very good at computing input to outputs or A to B
46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,190
mappings, given an input A, give me an output.
47
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,210
For Example, given an email, we can use supervised
48
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,060
learning to label it as spam or not spam.
49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,100
The most lucrative application of this
50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,680
that I've ever worked on is probably online advertising,
51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,338
where given an ad, we can label if a user
52
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:38,880
likely to click on it, and therefore,
53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,350
show more relevant ads.
54
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,530
For self-driving cars, given the sensor readings of a car,
55
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,780
we can label it with where are the other cars.
56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,850
One project, that my team, AI Fund, worked on
57
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,200
was ship route optimization.
58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,590
Where given a route the ship is taking or considering taking,
59
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,690
we can label that with how much fuel
60
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,940
we think this will consume, and use this to make
61
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,980
ships more fuel efficient.
62
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,620
Did a lot of work in automated visual inspection in factories.
63
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,620
So you can take a picture of a smartphone, that
64
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,840
was just manufactured and label, is there a scratch
65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
or any other defect in it.
66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Or if you want to build a restaurant review, reputation
67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,040
monitoring system, you can have a little piece of software
68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
that looks at online restaurant reviews,
69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,060
and labels that as positive or negative sentiment.
70
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,840
So one nice thing, one cool thing about supervised learning
71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,870
is that it's not useful for one thing, it's useful for all
72
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,080
of these different applications, and many more, besides.
73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,060
Let me just walk through, concretely,
74
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,630
the workflow one example of a supervised learning,
75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,430
labeling things kind of project.
76
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,250
If you want to build a system to label restaurant reviews,
77
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,130
you then collect a few data points or collect a data set.
78
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,740
Where it say, the pastrami sandwich great,
79
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,330
say that is positive.
80
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,790
Servers are slow, that's negative.
81
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,340
My favorite chicken curry, that's positive.
82
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,853
And here, I've shown three data points,
83
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:54,270
but you are building this, you may
84
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,340
get thousands of data points like this
85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,410
or thousands of training examples, we call it.
86
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,140
And the workflow of a machine learning project, of an AI
87
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,840
project is, you get labeled data, maybe
88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
thousands of data points.
89
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,640
Then you have an AI entry team train an AI
90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,590
model to learn from this data.
91
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,300
And then finally, you would find,
92
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,840
maybe a cloud service to run the trained AI model.
93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,690
And then you can feed it, best bubble tea I've ever had,
94
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,640
and that's positive sentiment.
95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,610
And so, I think the last decade was maybe
96
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,850
the decade of large scale supervised learning.
97
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,910
What we found, starting about 10, 15 years ago
98
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,190
was if you were to train a small AI model,
99
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,440
so train a small neural network or small deep learning
100
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,450
algorithm, basically, a small AI model,
101
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,850
maybe not on a very powerful computer,
102
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,585
then as you fed it more data, its performance
103
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:42,960
would get better for a little bit
104
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,250
but then it would flatten out.
105
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,020
It would plateau, and it would stop
106
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,240
being able to use the data to get better and better.
107
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,340
But if you were to train a very large AI model, lots of compute
108
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,200
on maybe powerful GPUs, then as we scaled up the amount of data
109
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,203
we gave the machine learning model,
110
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,620
its performance would kind of keep
111
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,280
on getting better and better.
112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
So this is why when I started and led the Google Brain
113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,330
team, the primary mission that I directed the team to solve,
114
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,080
at the time, was let's just build really,
115
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,870
really large neural networks, that we then fed a lot of data
116
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,370
to.
117
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,350
And that recipe, fortunately, worked.
118
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,650
And I think the idea of driving large compute
119
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,820
and large scale of data, that recipe's really helped us,
120
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,250
driven a lot of AI progress over the last decade.
121
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,790
So if that was the last decade of AI,
122
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,250
I think this decade is turning out
123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,890
to be also doing everything we had in supervised
124
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,630
learning but adding to it the exciting tool of generative AI.
125
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,390
So many of you, maybe all of you,
126
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,800
have played with ChatGPT and Bard, and so on.
127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,360
But just given a piece of text, which you call a prompt,
128
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,880
like I love eating, if you run this multiple times,
129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,940
maybe you get bagels cream cheese or my mother's meatloaf
130
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,520
or out with friends, and the AI system
131
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,100
can generate output like that.
132
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,780
Given the amounts of buzz and excitement about generative AI,
133
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,070
I thought I'd take just half a slide to say a little bit
134
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,880
about how this works.
135
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,670
So it turns out that generative AI, at least this type of text
136
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,910
generation, the core of it is using supervised
137
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,420
learning that inputs output mappings to repeatedly predict
138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,540
the next word.
139
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,270
And so, if your system reads, on the internet,
140
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,380
a sentence like, my favorite food is a bagel with cream
141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,310
cheese and lox, then this is translated into a few data
142
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,835
points, where if it sees, my favorite food is A,
143
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:37,110
in this case, try to guess that the right next word was bagel
144
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,600
or my favorite food is a bagel, try
145
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,900
to guess the next word is with, and similarly,
146
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,570
if it sees that, in this case, the right guess
147
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,970
for the next word would have been cream.
148
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,940
So by taking texts that you find on the internet
149
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,930
or other sources, and by using this input, output, supervised
150
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,390
learning to try to repeatedly predict the next word,
151
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,710
if you train a very large AI system on hundreds of billions
152
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,050
of words, or in the case of the largest models, now
153
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,330
more than a trillion words, then you get a large language model
154
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,440
like ChatGPT.
155
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,430
And there are additional, other important technical details.
156
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,140
I talked about predicting the next word.
157
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,910
Technically, these systems predict
158
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,790
the next subword or part of a word called a token,
159
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,120
and then there are other techniques like RLHF
160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,900
for further tuning the AI output to be more helpful, honest,
161
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,770
and harmless.
162
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,220
But at the heart of it is this using supervised
163
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,440
learning to repeatedly predict the next word.
164
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,340
That's really what's enabling the exciting, really
165
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,760
fantastic progress on large language models.
166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,180
So while many people have seen large language models
167
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,100
as a fantastic consumer tool.
168
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
You can go to a website like ChatGPT's website
169
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,020
or Bard's or other large language models
170
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,730
and use it as a fantastic tool.
171
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,190
There's one other trend, I think is still underappreciated,
172
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,090
which is the power of large language models,
173
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,130
not just as a consumer tool but as a developer tool.
174
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,580
So it turns out that there are applications
175
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,170
that used to take me months to build, that a lot of people
176
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,190
can now build much faster by using a large language model.
177
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,340
So specifically, the workflow for supervised learning,
178
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,990
building the restaurant review system,
179
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,500
say, would be that you need to get a bunch of labeled data,
180
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,310
and maybe that takes a month, we get a few thousand data points.
181
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,669
And then have an AI team train, and tune,
182
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,210
and really get optimized performance on your AI model.
183
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,610
Maybe that'll take three months.
184
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,070
Then find a cloud service to run it.
185
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,480
Make sure it's running robustly.
186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Make sure it's recognized, maybe that'll
187
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,760
take another three months.
188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,590
So pretty realistic timeline for building a commercial grade
189
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,630
machine learning system is like 6 to 12 months.
190
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,610
And so teams I've led, we often took roughly 6 to 12 months
191
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,260
to build and deploy these systems.
192
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,930
And some of them turned out to be really valuable.
193
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,380
But this is a realistic timeline for building and deploying
194
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,260
a commercial grade AI system.
195
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,500
In contrast, with prompt-based AI, where you write a prompt.
196
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,410
This is what the workflow looks like.
197
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,160
You can specify a prompt, that takes maybe minutes or hours.
198
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,340
And then, you can deploy it to the cloud,
199
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,750
and that takes maybe hours or days.
200
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,930
So there are now certain AI applications
201
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,170
that used to take me, literally, six months,
202
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,310
maybe a year to build, that many teams around the world
203
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,200
can now build in maybe a week.
204
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,900
And I think this is already starting,
205
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,730
but the best is still yet to come.
206
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,940
This is starting to open up a flood of a lot more AI
207
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,530
applications that can be built by a lot of people.
208
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,410
So I think many people still underestimate
209
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,930
the magnitude of the flood of custom AI applications
210
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,940
that I think is going to come down the pipe.
211
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,780
Now, I know you probably were not
212
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,500
expecting me to write code in this presentation,
213
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,350
but that's what I'm going to do.
214
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,250
So it turns out, this is all the code
215
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,890
that I need in order to write a sentiment classifier.
216
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,297
So I'm going to--
217
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,880
some of you will know Python, I guess.
218
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,400
Import some tools from OpenAI, and then
219
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,120
add this prompt, that says, classify the text below
220
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,160
delimited by three dashes as having
221
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,270
either a positive or negative sentiment.
222
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,305
[INAUDIBLE],, I had a fantastic time at Stanford GSB.
223
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,930
Learnt a lot, and also made great new friends.
224
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,530
All right.
225
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,603
So that's my prompt.
226
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,020
And then I'm just going to run it.
227
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,228
And I've never run it before.
228
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,163
So I really hope--
229
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:47,830
thank goodness, it got the right answer.
230
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,626
[APPLAUSE]
231
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,700
And this is literally all the code
232
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,200
it takes to build a sentiment classifier.
233
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,370
And so, today, developers around the world
234
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,260
can take, literally, maybe 10 minutes
235
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,900
to build a system like this.
236
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,120
And that's a very exciting development.
237
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,910
So one of the things I've been working on
238
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,500
was trying to teach online classes about how
239
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,270
to use prompting, not just as a consumer
240
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,890
tool but as a developer too.
241
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,400
So just talking about the technology landscape,
242
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,210
let me now share my thoughts on what are some
243
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,960
of the AI opportunities I see.
244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,680
This shows what I think is the value of different AI
245
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,590
technologies today, and I'll talk about three years
246
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,320
from now.
247
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,090
But the vast majority of financial value from AI today
248
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,220
is, I think, supervised learning,
249
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,590
where for a single company like Google
250
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,650
can be worth more than $100 billion US a year.
251
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,590
And also, there are millions of developers
252
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,670
building supervised learning applications.
253
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,390
So it's already massively valuable, and also
254
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,490
with tremendous momentum behind it just because
255
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,220
of the sheer effort in finding applications
256
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,780
and building applications.
257
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,560
And then, generative AI is the really exciting new entrant,
258
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,872
which is much smaller right now.
259
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:15,330
And then, there are the other tools
260
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,416
that I'm including for completeness.
261
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,600
If the size of these circles represent the value today,
262
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,540
this is what I think it might grow to in three years.
263
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,660
So supervised learning, already really massive,
264
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,820
may double, say, in the next three
265
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,910
years, from truly massive to even more massive.
266
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,313
And generative AI, which is much smaller today, I think,
267
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,730
will much more than double in the next three years because
268
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,280
of the number-- the amount of developer interest,
269
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,770
the amount of venture capital investments,
270
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,680
the number of large corporates exploring applications.
271
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,300
And I also just want to point out,
272
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,430
three years is a very short time horizon.
273
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,350
If it continues to compound in anything near this rate,
274
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,560
then in six years, it will be even vastly larger.
275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
But this light shaded region in green or orange,
276
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,090
that light shaded region is where the opportunity is
277
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,660
for either new startups or for large companies, incumbents,
278
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,947
to create and to enjoy value capture.
279
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:12,030
But one thing I hope you take away from this slide
280
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,890
is that all of these technologies
281
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,730
are general purpose technologies.
282
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,940
So in the case of supervised learning,
283
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,340
a lot of the work that had to be done over the last decade,
284
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,290
but is continuing for the next decade,
285
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,310
is to identify and to execute on the concrete use cases.
286
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,260
And that process is also kicking off for generative AI.
287
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,010
So for this part of the presentation,
288
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,790
I hope you take away from it that general purpose technology
289
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,370
is a useful for many different tasks, lot of value
290
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,380
remains to be created using supervised learning.
291
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,890
And even though, we're nowhere near finishing figuring out
292
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,680
the exciting use cases of supervised learning,
293
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,310
we have this other fantastic tool of generative AI, which
294
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,390
further expands the set of things we can now do using AI.
295
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,580
But one caveat, which is that there will be
296
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,540
short term fads along the way.
297
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,440
So I don't know if some of you might
298
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,750
remember the app called Lensa.
299
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,760
This is the app that will let you
300
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,390
upload pictures of yourself, and then
301
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,970
will render a cool picture of you
302
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,730
as an astronaut or a scientist or something.
303
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,920
And it was a good idea and people liked it.
304
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,320
And its revenue just took off like crazy like that,
305
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,160
through last December.
306
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,990
And then it did that.
307
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,070
And that's because Lensa was-- it was a good idea.
308
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,060
People liked it.
309
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,700
But it was a relatively thin software layer
310
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,880
on top of someone else's really powerful APIs.
311
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,910
And so even though it was a useful product,
312
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,500
it was in a defensible business.
313
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,350
And when I think about apps like Lensa,
314
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm actually reminded of when Steve Jobs gave us the iPhone.
315
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,100
Shortly after, someone wrote an app
316
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,290
that I paid $1.99 for, to do this, to turn on the LED,
317
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,480
to turn the phone into a flashlight.
318
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,810
And that was also a good idea to write an app
319
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,910
to turn on the LED light, but it also
320
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,740
wasn't a defensible long term--
321
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,810
also didn't create very long term value
322
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,690
because it was easily replicated, and underpriced,
323
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,390
and eventually incorporated into iOS.
324
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,510
But with the rise of iOS, with the rise of iPhone,
325
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,630
someone also figured out how to build things like Uber,
326
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,620
and Airbnb, and Tinder.
327
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,170
The very long term, very defensible businesses
328
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,940
that created sustaining value.
329
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,900
And I think, with the rise of generative AI
330
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,530
or the rise of new AI tools, I think, really,
331
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,360
what excites me is the opportunity
332
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,950
to create those really deep, really hard applications that
333
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,230
hopefully can create very long term value.
334
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,840
So the first trend I want to share
335
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,620
is AI is a general purpose technology.
336
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,453
And a lot of the work that lies ahead of us,
337
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:50,995
is to find the very diverse use cases and to build them.
338
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,290
There's a second trend I want to share
339
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,620
with you, which relates to why AI isn't more widely adopted
340
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,340
yet.
341
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,680
It feels like a bunch of us have been talking about AI
342
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,520
for 15 years or something.
343
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,450
But if you look at where the value of AI is today,
344
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,510
a lot of it is still very concentrated in consumer
345
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,680
software internet.
346
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,800
Once you got outside tech or consumer software internet,
347
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,940
there's some AI adoption but it all feels very early.
348
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,710
So why is that?
349
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,480
It turns out, if you were to take
350
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,880
all current and potential AI projects,
351
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,880
and sort them in decreasing order of value,
352
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,580
then to the left of this curve, of the head of this curve,
353
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,720
are the multi-billion dollar projects like advertising
354
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,530
or web search or for e-commerce product recommendations
355
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,210
or company like Amazon.
356
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,333
And it turns out that about 10, 15 years ago,
357
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,750
[? there's ?] my friends and I, we
358
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,480
figured out a recipe for how to hire, say,
359
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,690
100 engineers to write one piece of software
360
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,450
to serve more relevant ads, and apply that one
361
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,460
piece of software to a billion users,
362
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,390
and generate massive financial value.
363
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,300
So that works.
364
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,690
But once you go outside consumer software internet,
365
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,110
hardly anyone has 100 million or a billion users
366
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,290
that you can write and apply one piece of software to.
367
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,869
So once you go to other industries,
368
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,329
as we go from the head of this curve on the left
369
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,869
over to the long tail, these are some of the projects I see,
370
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,640
and I'm excited about.
371
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,369
I was working with a pizza maker that
372
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,349
was taking pictures of the pizza they were making because they
373
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,849
needed to do things like make sure that the cheese is spread
374
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,700
evenly.
375
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,020
So this is about a $5 million project.
376
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,040
But that recipe of hiring a hundred engineers or dozens
377
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,410
of engineers to work on a $5 million
378
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,260
project, that doesn't make sense.
379
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,550
Or there's another great example.
380
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,670
Working with a agriculture company
381
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,880
that with them, we figured out that if we use cameras
382
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,800
to find out how tall is the wheat,
383
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,300
and wheat is often bent over because
384
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,310
of wind or rain or something, and we
385
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,290
can chop off the wheat at the right height,
386
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,990
then that results in more food for the farmer to sell,
387
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,980
and is also better for the environment.
388
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,850
But this is another $5 million project,
389
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,300
that that old recipe of hiring a large group of highly
390
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,770
skilled engineers to work on this one project, that
391
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,150
doesn't make sense.
392
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,730
And similarly materials grading, cloth grading,
393
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,440
sheet metal grading, many projects like this.
394
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,100
So whereas to the left, in the head of this curve,
395
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,350
there's a small number of, let's say,
396
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,150
multi-billion dollar projects, and we
397
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,910
know how to execute those delivering value.
398
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,600
In other industries, I'm seeing a very long tail
399
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,270
of tens of thousands, of let's call them,
400
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,940
$5 million projects, that until now,
401
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,800
have been very difficult to execute on
402
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,710
because of the high cost of customization.
403
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,450
The trend that I think is exciting
404
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,260
is that the AI community has been building better tools that
405
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,570
lets us aggregate these use cases,
406
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,850
and make it easy for the end user to do the customization.
407
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,880
So specifically, I'm seeing a lot
408
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,390
of exciting low code and no code tools, that
409
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,670
enable the user to customize the AI system.
410
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,790
What this means is instead of me,
411
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,270
needing to worry that much about pictures of pizza,
412
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,530
we have tools--
413
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,990
we're starting to see tools that can enable
414
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,900
the IT department of the pizza making factory
415
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,600
to train AI system on their own pictures of pizza
416
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,460
to realize this $5 million worth of value.
417
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,305
And by the way, the pictures of pizza,
418
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,680
they don't exist on the internet.
419
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,480
So Google and Bing don't have access to these pictures,
420
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,750
we need tools that can be used by, really,
421
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,700
the pizza factory themselves, to build, and deploy,
422
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,630
and maintain their own custom AI system that works
423
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,910
on their own pictures of pizza.
424
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:39,010
And broadly, the technology for enabling this, some of it
425
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,580
is prompting, text prompting, visual prompting,
426
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,430
but really, large language models and similar tools
427
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,510
like that or a technology called data-centric AI, whereby,
428
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,950
instead of asking the pizza factory to write a lot of code,
429
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,140
which is challenging, we can ask them to provide data which
430
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,840
turns out to be more feasible.
431
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,780
And I think the second trend is important,
432
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,600
because I think this is a key part of the recipe for taking
433
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,180
the value of AI, which so far still feels
434
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,030
very concentrated in the tech world and the consumer software
435
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,900
internet world, and pushing this out to all industries, really
436
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,820
to the rest of the economy, which--
437
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,220
sometimes it's easy to forget, the rest of the economy
438
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,810
is much bigger than the tech world.
439
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,550
So the two trends I shared, AI as a general purpose
440
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,860
technology, lots of concrete use cases
441
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,760
to be realized as well as low code, no code, easy to use
442
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,990
tools, enabling AI to be deployed in more industries.
443
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,210
How do we go after these opportunities?
444
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,030
So about five years ago, there was a puzzle I wanted to solve,
445
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,530
which is--
446
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,600
I felt that many valuable AI projects are now possible.
447
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,780
And I was thinking, how do we get them done?
448
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,400
And having led teams in Google, and Baidu, in big tech
449
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,340
companies, I had a hard time figuring out
450
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,000
how I could operate a team in a big tech company
451
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,750
to go after a very diverse set of opportunities in everything
452
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,102
from maritime shipping to education to financial services
453
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:09,310
to healthcare, and on and on.
454
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,980
It's just very diverse use cases, very diverse
455
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,430
go to markets, and very diverse customer bases
456
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,560
and applications.
457
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,770
And I felt that the most efficient way
458
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,390
to do this would be if we can start
459
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,370
a lot of different companies to pursue these very
460
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,030
diverse opportunities.
461
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,510
So that's why I ended up starting AI Fund, which
462
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,850
is a venture studio that builds startups
463
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,880
to pursue a diverse set of AI opportunities.
464
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,580
And, of course, in addition to lots of startups,
465
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,770
incumbent companies also have a lot
466
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,500
of opportunities to integrate AI into existing businesses.
467
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,360
In fact, one pattern I'm seeing for incumbent businesses is
468
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,490
distribution is often one of the significant advantages
469
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,100
of incumbent companies, if they play their cards right,
470
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,340
can allow them to integrate AI into their products,
471
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,630
quite efficiently.
472
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,610
But just to be concrete, where are the opportunities?
473
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,200
So I think of this as-- this is what I think of as an AI stack.
474
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,680
At the bottom level is the hardware, semiconductor layer.
475
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,220
Fantastic opportunities there, but very capital intensive,
476
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,510
very concentrated.
477
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,850
So needs a lot of resources, relatively few winners.
478
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,810
So some people can and should play there.
479
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,020
I personally don't like to play there myself.
480
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,880
There's also the infrastructure layer.
481
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,120
Also fantastic opportunities, but very capital intensive,
482
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,320
very concentrated.
483
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,810
So I tend not to play there myself, either.
484
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,200
And then there's the developer tool layer.
485
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,940
What I showed you just now was--
486
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,450
I was actually using OpenAI's API as a developer tool.
487
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,850
And then, I think the developer tool
488
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,400
sector is a hypercompetitive.
489
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,460
Look at all the startups chasing OpenAI right now.
490
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,920
But there will be some mega winners.
491
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,400
And so I sometimes play here, but primarily,
492
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,770
when I think of a meaningful technology advantage,
493
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,840
because I think that earns you the right
494
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,600
or earns you a better shot at being one of the mega winners.
495
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,230
And then lastly, even though a lot of the media attention
496
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,050
and the buzz is in the infrastructure and developer
497
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,160
tooling layer, it turns out that layer can be successful
498
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,450
only if the application layer is even more successful.
499
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,790
And we saw this with the rise of SaaS as well.
500
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,550
Lot of the buzz and excitement is on the technology,
501
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,597
the tooling layer.
502
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:22,180
Which is fine.
503
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Nothing wrong with that.
504
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,170
But the only way for that to be successful
505
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,882
is if the application layer is even more successful,
506
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:29,340
so that, frankly, they can generate
507
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,550
enough revenue to pay the infrastructure, and the tooling
508
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,330
layer.
509
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,540
So, actually, let me mention one example.
510
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,900
Amorai-- I was actually just texting the CEO yesterday.
511
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,630
But Amorai is a company that we built
512
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,180
that uses AI for romantic relationship coaching.
513
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,830
And just to point out, I'm an AI guy.
514
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:56,640
And I feel like I know nothing really about romance.
515
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,090
And if you don't believe me, you can ask my wife,
516
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,750
she will confirm that I know nothing about romance.
517
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,460
But when we went to build this, we
518
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,360
wanted to get together with the former CEO of Tinder, Renate
519
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,990
Nyborg.
520
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,810
And with my team's expertise in AI,
521
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,850
and her expertise in relationships
522
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,700
because she ran Tinder, she knows more about relationships
523
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,440
than I think anyone I know, we're
524
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,540
able to build something pretty unique using
525
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,040
AI for kind of romantic relationship mentoring.
526
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,560
And the interesting thing about applications like these
527
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,550
is when we look around, how many teams in the world
528
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,720
are simultaneously expert in AI and in relationships?
529
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,850
And so at the application layer, I'm
530
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,760
seeing a lot of exciting opportunities
531
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,040
that seem to have a very large market,
532
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,410
but where the competition sets is
533
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,030
very light, relative to the magnitude of the opportunity.
534
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,655
It's not that there are no competitors,
535
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,240
but it's just much less intense compared to the developer tool
536
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,860
or the infrastructure layers.
537
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,810
And so, because I've spent a lot of time iterating
538
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,510
on a process of building startups, what I'm going to do
539
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,220
is just, very transparently, tell
540
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,470
you the recipe we've developed for building startups.
541
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,370
And so after many years of iteration and improvement,
542
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,610
this is how we now build startups.
543
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,430
My team's always had access to a lot of different ideas,
544
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,100
internally generated, ideas from partners.
545
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,190
And I want to walk through this with one example of something
546
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,530
we did, which is a company Bearing AI,
547
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,750
which uses AI to make ships more fuel efficient.
548
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,800
So this idea came to me when, a few years ago,
549
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,310
a large Japanese conglomerate called Mitsui,
550
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,900
that is a major shareholder and operates major shipping lines,
551
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,330
they came to me and they said, hey, Andrew, you
552
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,330
should build a business to use AI to make ships more fuel
553
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,290
efficient.
554
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,870
And the specific idea was, think of it
555
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,490
as a Google Maps for ships.
556
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,700
We can suggest a ship or tell a ship how to steer,
557
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,220
so that you still get to your destination on time,
558
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,380
but using, it turns out, about 10% less fuel.
559
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,220
And so what we now do is we spend about a month,
560
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,420
validating the idea.
561
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,300
So double check, is this idea even technically feasible,
562
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,883
and then talk to prospective customers
563
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:11,383
to make sure there is a market need.
564
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,200
So we spent up to about a month doing that.
565
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400
And if it passes this stage, then we
566
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,210
will go and recruit a CEO to work with us on the project.
567
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,160
When I was starting, out I used to spend
568
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,320
a long time working on a project myself,
569
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,550
before bringing on a CEO.
570
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,250
But after iterating, we realized that bringing
571
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,170
on a leader at the very beginning
572
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,980
to work with us, it reduces a lot of the burden of having
573
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,320
to transfer knowledge or having a CEO come in
574
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,730
and having to revalidate what [? we ?] discovered.
575
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,030
So the process is, we've, learned much more efficient,
576
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,000
we just bring the leader at the very start.
577
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,890
And so in the case of Bearing AI,
578
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,050
we found a fantastic CEO, Dylan Keil,
579
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,200
who is a reputed entrepreneur, one successful exit before.
580
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,950
And then we spent three months, six, two week sprints,
581
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,500
to work with them to build a prototype
582
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,380
as well as do deep customer validation.
583
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,650
If it survives this stage, and we
584
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,890
have about a two thirds, 66% survival rate,
585
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,510
we then write the first check in,
586
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,640
which then gives the company resources
587
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,970
to hire an executive team, build the key team,
588
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,760
get an MVP working, minimum viable product working,
589
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,680
and get some real customers.
590
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,260
And then after that, hopefully, then successfully
591
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,030
raises additional external rounds of funding,
592
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,360
and can keep on growing and scaling.
593
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,760
So I'm really proud of the work that my team
594
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,140
was able to do to support Mitsui's idea, and Dylan Keil,
595
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,950
as CEO.
596
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,250
And today, there are hundreds of ships, on the high seas
597
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,400
right now, that are steering themselves differently
598
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,750
because of Bearing AI.
599
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,340
And 10% fuel savings translates to around to maybe
600
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,890
$450,000 in savings in fuel, per, ship per year.
601
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,460
And, of course, it's also, frankly, quite a bit better
602
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,000
for the environment.
603
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,980
And I think this startup, I think,
604
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,550
would not have existed if not for Dylan's fantastic work,
605
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,340
and then also, Mitsui bringing this idea to me.
606
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,320
And I like this example because this is another one is like--
607
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,530
this is a startup idea that, just to point out,
608
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,870
I would never have come up with myself.
609
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,420
Because I've been on a boat but what
610
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,210
do I know about maritime shipping.
611
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,020
But is the deep subject matter expertise of Mitsui,
612
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,870
that had this insight, together with Dylan,
613
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,930
and then my team's expertise in AI, that made this possible.
614
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:33,130
And so as I operate in AI, one thing I've learned
615
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,010
is my swim lane is AI, and that's it.
616
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,220
Because I don't have time or it's very difficult for me
617
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,020
to be expert in maritime shipping,
618
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,330
and romantic relationships, and health care,
619
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,710
and financial services, and on, and on, and on.
620
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,800
And so I've learned that if I can just
621
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,220
help get a accurate technical validation,
622
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,860
and then use AI resources to make sure
623
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,450
the AI tech is built quickly and well,
624
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,990
and I think, we've always managed
625
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,210
to help the companies build a strong technical team,
626
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,240
then partnering with subject matter experts often results
627
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,030
in exciting new opportunities.
628
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,930
And I want to share with you one other weird aspect of--
629
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,610
one other weird thing I've learned
630
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,000
about building startups, which is I
631
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
like to engage only when there's a concrete idea.
632
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,060
And this runs counter to a lot of the advice you
633
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,630
hear from the design thinking methodology, which often says,
634
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,430
don't rush to solutioning.
635
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,340
Explore a lot of alternatives before you do a solution.
636
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,880
Honestly, we tried that, it was very slow.
637
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,850
But what we've learned is that at the ideation
638
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,880
stage, if someone comes to me and says, hey, Andrew,
639
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,280
you should apply AI to financial services.
640
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,730
Because I'm not a subject matter expert in financial services,
641
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,860
it's very slow for me to go and learn
642
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,553
enough about financial services, to figure out what to do.
643
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,720
I mean, eventually, you could get to a good outcome,
644
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,460
but it's a very labor intensive, very slow,
645
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,480
very expensive process, for me, to try to learn industry
646
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,710
after industry.
647
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,980
In contrast, one of my partners wrote this idea
648
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,200
as a tongue in cheek, not really seriously.
649
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,290
But, let's say, [INAUDIBLE] by GPT,
650
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,630
let's eliminate commercials by automatically
651
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,160
buying every product advertised in exchange for not having
652
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,430
to see any ads, it's not a good idea,
653
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,160
but it is a concrete idea.
654
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,910
And it turns out, concrete ideas can be validated or falsified,
655
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,100
efficiently.
656
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,190
They also give a team a clear direction to execute.
657
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,240
And I've learned that in today's world,
658
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,020
especially, with the excitement, the buzz, the exposure to AI
659
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,510
of a lot of people, it turns out that there
660
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,090
are a lot of subject matter experts in today's world,
661
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,630
that have deeply thought about a problem for months, sometimes
662
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,680
even one or two years.
663
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,600
But they've not yet had a build partner.
664
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,350
And when we get together with them, and hear,
665
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,880
and they share the idea of us, it
666
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,130
allows us to work with them to very quickly go
667
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,360
into validation and building.
668
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,840
And I find that this works because there
669
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,170
are a lot of people that have already done the design
670
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,430
thinking thing of exploring a lot of ideas and winnowing
671
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,870
down to really good ideas.
672
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,550
And there are-- I find that there are so
673
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,170
many good ideas sitting out there,
674
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,850
that no one is working on.
675
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,670
That finding those good ideas that someone has already
676
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,420
had, and wants to share with us, and wants to build partner for,
677
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,890
that turns out to be a much more efficient engine.
678
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,880
So before I wrap up, we'll go to the question in a second,
679
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,910
just a few slides to talk about risk and social impact.
680
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,020
So AI is very powerful technology.
681
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,420
To say something you'd probably guess, my teams and I,
682
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,060
we only work on projects that move humanity forward.
683
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,810
And we have multiple times killed projects
684
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,570
that we assess to be financially sound, based
685
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,500
on ethical grounds.
686
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,960
It turns out, I've been surprised
687
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,170
and sometimes dismayed at the creativity of people
688
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,280
to come up with good ideas.
689
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,120
So to come up with really bad ideas that
690
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,300
seem profitable but really should not be built.
691
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,370
We've killed a few projects on those grounds.
692
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,450
And then, I think, has to be acknowledged that AI today
693
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,810
does have problems with bias, fairness, and accuracy.
694
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,930
But also the technology is improving quickly.
695
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,300
So I see that AI systems today are
696
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,850
less biased than six months ago, and more
697
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,890
fair than six months ago, which is not
698
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,990
to dismiss the importance of these problems.
699
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,390
They are problems and we should continue to work on them.
700
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,730
But I'm also gratified at the number
701
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,740
of teams working hard on these issues
702
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,450
to make them much better.
703
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,290
When I think of the biggest risks of AI.
704
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,750
I think that the biggest risks--
705
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,200
one of the biggest risks is the disruption to jobs.
706
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,970
This is a diagram from a paper by our friend at the University
707
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,190
of Pennsylvania, and some folks at OpenAI,
708
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,070
analyzing the exposure of different jobs
709
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,870
to AI automation.
710
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,130
And it turns out that, whereas, the previous wave of automation
711
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,330
mainly--
712
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,330
the most exposed jobs were often the lower wage jobs,
713
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,020
such as when we put robots into factories.
714
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,330
With this current wave of automation,
715
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,910
is actually the higher wage jobs, further,
716
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,130
to the right of this axis, that seems
717
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,140
to have more of their tasks exposed to automation.
718
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,410
So even as we create tremendous value using AI,
719
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,685
I feel like, as citizens, and our corporations,
720
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:16,060
and our governments, and, really,
721
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,850
our society, I feel a strong obligation
722
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,270
to make sure that people, especially people whose
723
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,990
livelihoods are disrupted, are still well taken care of,
724
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,650
are still treated well.
725
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,480
And then lastly, there's also been--
726
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,900
it feels like every time there's a big wave of progress in AI,
727
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,590
there's a big wave of hype about artificial general intelligence
728
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,280
as well.
729
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,990
When DeepLearning started work really well 10 years ago,
730
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,437
there was a lot of hype about AGI.
731
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,520
And now, the generative AI is working really well,
732
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,160
there's another wave of hype about AGI.
733
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,157
But I think that artificial general intelligence,
734
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,740
AI that can do anything a human can do
735
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,410
is still decades away, maybe 30 to 50 years, maybe even longer.
736
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,960
I hope we'll see it in our lifetimes.
737
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,690
But I don't think there's any time soon.
738
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,530
One of the challenges is that the biological path
739
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,230
to intelligence, like humans and the digital path
740
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,310
to intelligence, AI, they've taken very different paths.
741
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,770
And the funny thing about the definition of AGI
742
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,040
is you're benchmarking this very different digital path
743
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,762
to intelligence with really the biological path
744
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:22,429
to intelligence.
745
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,489
So I think, large language models are smarter
746
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,409
than any of us in certain key dimensions,
747
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,350
but much dumber than any of us in other dimensions.
748
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,929
And so forcing it to do everything a human can do
749
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,699
is like a funny comparison.
750
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,139
But I hope we'll get there.
751
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,980
Hopefully, within our lifetimes.
752
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,520
And then there's also a lot of, I think,
753
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,540
overblown hype about AI creating extinction risks for humanity.
754
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,900
Candidly, I don't see it.
755
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,889
I just don't see how AI creates any meaningful extinction
756
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,270
risk for humanity.
757
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,219
I think that people worry we can't control AI.
758
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,090
But we have lots of, AI will be more powerful than any person.
759
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,000
But with lots of experience, steering, very powerful
760
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,310
entities, such as corporations or nation states that
761
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,980
are far more powerful than any single person,
762
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,730
and making sure they, for the most part, benefit humanity.
763
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,610
And also technology develops gradually.
764
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,130
The so-called hot take off scenario,
765
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,840
where it's not really working today,
766
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,640
and then suddenly, one day, overnight,
767
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,100
it works brilliantly, and we achieve super intelligence,
768
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,360
takes over the world.
769
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,900
That's just not realistic.
770
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,650
And I think the AI technology will develop slowly,
771
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,760
like all the--
772
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
and then it gives us plenty of time
773
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,440
to make sure that we provide oversight and can
774
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,090
manage it to be safe.
775
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,910
And lastly, if you look at the real extinction risk
776
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,330
to humanity, such as, fingers crossed,
777
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,090
the next pandemic or climate change,
778
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,640
leading to a massive de-population of some parts
779
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,060
of the planet, or much lower odds, but maybe someday,
780
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,810
an asteroid doing to us what it had done to the dinosaurs.
781
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,270
I think if we look at the actual real extinction
782
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:01,230
risk to humanity, AI having more intelligence,
783
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,060
even artificial intelligence in the world,
784
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,230
would be a key part of the solution.
785
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,760
So I feel like if you want humanity to survive and thrive
786
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,250
for the next 1,000 years, rather than slowing AI down,
787
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,240
which some people propose, I would rather
788
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,790
make AI go as fast as possible.
789
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,720
So with that, just to summarize, this is my last slide.
790
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,620
I think that AI, as a general purpose technology
791
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,010
creates a lot of new opportunities for everyone.
792
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,590
And a lot of the exciting and important work that
793
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,700
lies ahead of us all is to go and build those concrete use
794
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,730
cases, and hopefully, in the future,
795
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,890
hopefully, I'll have opportunities to maybe
796
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,610
engage with more of you on those opportunities as well.
797
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,080
So with that, let me just say, thank you all very much.
798
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,130
[APPLAUSE]
